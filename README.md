Findy 

An experimental contact list built on Ruby on Rails and JQuery to test the following features:

+ Using ajax calls managed by JQuery to get and post JSON to a rails server.

+ Building a search feature that live-updates the contacts displayed based on search parameters.

Test it out:

$ git clone https://github.com/clopez11/findy.git

$ bundle install

$ bundle exec rake db:migrate

$ rails s

Open up localhost:3000 on your browser and you're all set!
